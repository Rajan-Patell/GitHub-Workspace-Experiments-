# Enemy AI Behaviors

## Patrolling Behavior
Patrolling involves the enemy AI moving along a predetermined path, looping back to the start once the end is reached. This behavior utilizes pathfinding algorithms to navigate complex environments efficiently.

## Taking Cover Behavior
When under threat, the AI seeks nearby cover using environmental awareness. This dynamic decision-making process allows the AI to protect itself while assessing the situation and planning the next move.

## Attacking Strategies
The AI engages the player with a focus on targeting and engagement rules. This includes determining when to open fire, when to pursue, and when to retreat, based on the player's actions and the AI's current state.
