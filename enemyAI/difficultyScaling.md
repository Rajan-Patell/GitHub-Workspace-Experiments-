# Difficulty Scaling in Enemy AI

## Concept of Difficulty Scaling
Difficulty scaling in enemy AI refers to the adjustment of enemy behavior based on the player's progress and skill level. This ensures that the game remains challenging and engaging throughout.

## Effects on Enemy Decision-Making, Speed, and Accuracy
As the difficulty level increases:
- Enemy decision-making becomes faster and more strategic, making them harder to predict.
- The speed at which enemies move and react is increased, requiring quicker player responses.
- Accuracy of enemy attacks improves, making engagements more dangerous for the player.

## Examples of Scaling Difficulty
- Early game stages might feature enemies with slower reaction times and lower accuracy, focusing on introducing the player to combat mechanics.
- Mid-game stages increase the complexity of enemy strategies, introducing more varied behaviors such as flanking or coordinated attacks.
- Late-game stages present the highest challenge, with enemies exhibiting near-perfect accuracy and highly strategic behavior, pushing the player to master the game mechanics.
